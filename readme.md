I'm making this because I've never felt organized enough in my personal life. 

The end goal of this application will be to allow you to write yourself to dos with varying frequency, between daily, Today only, this week, this month and repeating intervals to help you keep everything organized and hopefully get that work done.
We're going to add functionality for Timers/reminders for events or even just the food in the oven.
